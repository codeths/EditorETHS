## How to Use Collaboration

### Creating a Room

1. Click the **üë• Collaborate** button in the header
2. Click **OK** when asked if you want to create a new room
3. Enter your name
4. You'll receive a **unique 6-character room code**
5. Share this code with your collaborators!

### Joining a Room

1. Click the **üë• Collaborate** button in the header
2. Click **Cancel** when asked if you want to create a new room
3. Enter the room code shared with you
4. Enter your name
5. You're in! You'll see all other participants in the panel

### Collaboration Features

- **Room Code Display**: The active room code is prominently displayed in the top-right
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Click the üìã button to copy the room code
- **Participants Panel**: See all active collaborators with their colored indicators
- **Real-time Updates**: Code changes sync instantly across all participants
- **Leave Session**: Click the **üî¥ Leave** button to exit the collaboration

### Sharing via URL

You can also share a direct join link:
```
http://your-domain.com/?room=ROOMCODE
```

Replace `ROOMCODE` with your actual room code. When someone opens this link, they'll be prompted to enter their name and will join automatically.

## Project Structure

```
EditorETHS/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main application (frontend + UI)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js           # Node.js server with Socket.IO
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json        # Dependencies and scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ render.yaml         # Render deployment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore         # Git ignore rules

```

## Deployment on Render

This application is configured for easy deployment on [Render](https://render.com).

### Automatic Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a Render Account**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up

3. **Deploy from Repository**
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
   - Click "Create Web Service"

4. **Access Your App**
   - Once deployed, Render will provide a URL like `https://your-app.onrender.com`
   - Share this URL with your users!

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)

If not using `render.yaml`:

- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Environment**: Node
- **Plan**: Free (or upgrade as needed)

### Environment Variables

The application works with default settings, but you can customize:

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000, Render auto-assigns)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` for production builds

## Technical Details

### Backend Architecture

- **Express.js**: Web server framework
- **Socket.IO**: WebSocket library for real-time communication
- **Room Management**: In-memory storage of active rooms and participants
- **Auto-cleanup**: Rooms are automatically cleaned up 1 hour after being empty

### Frontend Architecture

- **Pure JavaScript**: No frameworks, vanilla JS for maximum compatibility
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Local Storage**: Project persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet

### Real-time Protocol

The collaboration uses Socket.IO events:

- `create-room`: Create a new collaboration room
- `join-room`: Join an existing room
- `code-change`: Broadcast code changes
- `cursor-move`: Share cursor positions
- `participant-joined`: New participant notification
- `participant-left`: Participant departure notification

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Edge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è IE11 (limited support)

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is in use:
```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```

### Cannot Connect to Server

- Check if the server is running
- Verify firewall settings
- Ensure WebSocket connections are allowed

### Room Not Found

- Room codes are case-insensitive but must be exact
- Rooms expire after 1 hour of being empty
- Try creating a new room

### Code Not Syncing

- Check your internet connection
- Verify you're in the same room (check the room code)
- Try refreshing the page and rejoining

### Browser Extension Errors (Grammarly, Iterable, etc.)

If you see errors in the console like:
```
grm ERROR [iterable] Not supported: in app messages from Iterable
```

**This is NOT a bug in the application!** These errors come from browser extensions (Grammarly, Iterable, email tools, etc.) and can be safely ignored. They do not affect the collaboration functionality.

**To eliminate these errors:**
- Test in Incognito/Private mode (extensions are usually disabled)
- Temporarily disable browser extensions
- Or simply ignore them - they won't affect your experience

## Development

### Adding New Features

The codebase is organized into clear sections:

1. **HTML Structure** (line ~730): Header, menus, panels
2. **CSS Styles** (line ~7): All styling
3. **Core Editor Logic** (line ~880): Code editing functionality
4. **Collaboration System** (line ~2920): Real-time collaboration

### Testing Locally

To test collaboration locally:

1. Start the server
2. Open two browser windows
3. In the first, create a room
4. In the second, join using the room code
5. Make changes in either window and see them sync!

## Performance

- **Lightweight**: ~3MB total including all assets
- **Fast Sync**: Sub-100ms latency for local networks
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple concurrent rooms
- **Efficient**: Uses WebSocket for minimal overhead

## Security Notes

- Rooms use random 6-character codes (36^6 = 2+ billion combinations)
- No authentication required (designed for educational use)
- Code is not persisted server-side (privacy by design)
- For production use, consider adding authentication

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:

- [ ] Cursor position indicators (Google Docs style)
- [ ] Chat functionality
- [ ] Voice chat integration
- [ ] Project templates library
- [ ] Code history/undo across sessions
- [ ] Room passwords for private sessions
- [ ] Persistent rooms with database storage
- [ ] User authentication (OAuth, etc.)
